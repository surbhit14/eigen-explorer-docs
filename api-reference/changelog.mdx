## June 16, 2024 - Major Updates on Infrastructure

---

Over the past few weeks, we have been upgrading our infrastructure to enhance the performance and reliability of the EigenExplorer API. We are excited to announce the completion of these upgrades, which include:

1. Migrating our infrastructure to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with elastic scaling capabilities.
2. Implementing a new caching layer to improve response times.
3. Revamping the seeding operation to enhance data availability and reliability.

Additionally, we've made several improvements to the API:

1. API health checks and versioning for better monitoring and maintenance.
2. Providing consistent TVL data in both native and ETH values.
3. Adding new routes to track all stakers.

We anticipate a few major updates in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for more exciting news!

## May 20, 2024 - EigenLayer Withdrawal Data

We are thrilled to announce the addition of two new types of API routes for querying EigenLayer withdrawal data. Efficient withdrawal management is essential for overseeing and accounting for staking activities in the EigenLayer ecosystem. Now you can directly access `withdrawals` and `stakers/:address/withdrawals` routes to retrieve detailed withdrawal information.

1. Individual Routes - `/withdrawals`
   We’ve introduced brand new routes to query all withdrawal history or retrieve individual withdrawal data. Now, you can filter withdrawals by staker address, delegated operator, strategy address, and withdrawal status. This added flexibility allows you to pinpoint specific operators and combine various query parameters to suit your needs.

1. Nested Routes - `/stakers/{address}/withdrawals`
   To make your REST queries even smoother, we’ve rolled out nested routes that simplify the process of retrieving withdrawals for specific stakers. Use `/stakers/:address/withdrawals` to list all withdrawals for a staker. Plus, you can access queued, queued and withdrawable, and completed withdrawals through dedicated routes for more precise queries.

With these new withdrawal data routes, you can now access detailed information on staker withdrawals, greatly enhancing your ability to manage and analyze staking activities. As always, if you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to seeing how you leverage these new routes in your applications!

## May 14, 2024 - Data Quality, Standardization, and Consistency Improvements

Thanks to our users and community, we have crossed 100k requests and reached 3.4k unique users in the past month. In our latest update, we've focused on enhancing data quality, standardization, and consistency across the EigenExplorer platform. Key improvements include:

1. **Data Methodology Page**: Added a [Data Methodology](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/methodology) page to provide transparency on data sources and processing methods.
2. **Beacon Chain TVL Calculation**: Updated and aligned the calculation of Beacon Chain TVL with the methodology used on the EigenLayer Dashboard, thanks to feedback from our user [Karl](https://twitter.com/karl_0x).
3. **AVS Count and Listing**: Fixed the AVS count and listing display for AVSs without metadata.
4. **Eigen Token and Strategy**: Included `Eigen` token and strategy data.
5. **TVL Conversion Standardization**: Unified the TVL conversion to `ETH` for all LST strategies.

## May 2, 2024 - TVL Breakdown

Now, for selected routes, you can optionally add a `withTvl` flag to include the Total Value Locked (TVL) breakdown in the response.

This feature provides a detailed breakdown of the TVL for different strategies, saving time to calculate the TVL from shares in your aplication.

## May 1, 2024 - Additional API Routes and Usability Improvements

---

We're excited to announce the addition of two new routes to the EigenExplorer API, [Retrieve AVS Operators](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-total-number-of-avs-operators) and [Retrieve AVS Stakers](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-total-number-of-avs-stakers). These routes allow developers to track the current operators and stakers associated with a specific AVS address. We are excited to see how the new endpoints will be utilized in the various AVS applications.

Further enhancing the EigenExplorer platform, we've implemented significant usability improvements. Our redesigned error handling provides a top-tier developer experience, ensuring clearer and more actionable feedback. Additionally, we've enriched our API documentation with detailed examples and comprehensive response schemas, going the extra mile to support developers in integrating and leveraging our API effectively.

## April 19, 2024 - EigenLayer Ethereum Mainnet API

We are excited to announce the release of the EigenLayer Ethereum Mainnet API, following closely on the heels of our recent launch of the Holesky Testnet API earlier this week. This release achieves parity between the available on-chain data and API support across the EigenLayer smart contracts.

You can now access both the Ethereum Mainnet API at `https://api.eigenexplorer.com` and the Holesky Testnet API at `https://api-holesky.eigenexplorer.com` to programmatically retrieve EigenLayer data.

## April 15, 2024 - Initial API Release

---

Today we are releasing the first version of the EigenExplorer API, allowing developers to access EigenLayer AVS data programmatically. The API provides endpoints for retrieving general EigenLayer metrics, AVS, operators, and stakers data, as well as strategy information. In the upcoming days, we will be adding more endpoints and features to the API, including historical data and API authentication. We are excited to see what you will build with the EigenExplorer API!
