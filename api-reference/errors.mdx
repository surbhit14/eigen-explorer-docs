EigenExplorer API returns machine readable error codes, human readable error messages and a link to the docs for more information.

Here is how an error response looks like:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "not_found",
        "message": "The requested resource was not found.",
        "doc_url": "https://api.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/errors#not_found"
    }
}
```
